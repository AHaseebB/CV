       <h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
  <div>
  <p>I have obtained work experience in the University of
     Bedfordshire while working in the IT department. I cooperated with other
     people in the same field in software development, coding, operating
     devices, and making use of virtual software. W3Schools has also helped me develop my
     code skills.

   <h3>Skills</h3>
   <p>I am able to work on projects with other people and act
     decisively under circumstances where time is limited. I am able to
     clearly pass information throughout our teams and make plans for our
     final goals as well as how to get there. I have extensive knowledge on
     techonological subjects and have an interest in programming. Studying
     A-Level Computer Science has helped me learn about how computers work,
     and so I have an understanding on their internal structures. I also have
     excellent mathematical skills.

   <h3>Hobbies and Additional Information</h3>
     <p>I have been interested in technological products and gadgets
       ever since I was years younger; from opening devices up to see what's
       inside them and how they work, to learning the relation between a
       physical hardware and its software. I also code for fun from time to
       time, trying new commands every now and then.
